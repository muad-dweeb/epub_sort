# Utilities
Just some scripts to help me handle my own junk.

### recursive file management
**Rename or delete files nested in a directory tree.**

I would like to expand on this more.

### epub sort
**Sort an ePub directory.**

### fresh-setup.sh
**Automates the installation of preferred packages after a fresh Ubuntu install**
Make script executable with `chmod +x fresh-setup.sh`
Execute with `./filename.sh`
**Warning**
Currently untested. Use at your own risk.
